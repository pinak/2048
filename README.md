2048
====

My implementation of the game 2048 (which is a clone of three's) in C++.
The game is console only for now. I do have plans to implement a GUI using Qt to get familiar with it.


Build Instructions:
====================
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pinak/2048
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../2048
make
```
Then run the game binary in src/

Playing Instructions:
======================
Use w,a,s,d followed by enter key to perform a move.
